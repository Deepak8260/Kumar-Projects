# Analysis and Visualization of Global Population Data of 2021🌍📊

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset containing global population data by country for the year 2021. The goal is to visualize the distribution of populations, identify the top and least populous countries, and create various plots to understand the data better. 🎯

## Project Difficulty Level
Beginner level- Easiest

## Tools Used
1. Python
2. Pandas 
3. Plotly

## Dataset Details 📁
The dataset includes:
- **Country Name**: Name of the country. 🌏
- **2018, 2019, 2020, 2021**: Population figures for these years. 📅

For the analysis, we focused on the population data for the year 2021. 📈

## Data Preparation 🛠️
1. **Loading Data**: The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file. 📥
2. **Filtering Columns**: We extracted only the 'Country Name' and '2021' columns from the dataset. 🔍
3. **Renaming Columns**: The '2021' column was renamed to 'population' for clarity. ✏️
4. **Data Cleaning**: The population values were cleaned by removing commas and converting them to integers for numerical operations. 🧹

## Data Visualization 📊

### Histogram of Population Distribution 📈
- **Analysis**: The histogram shows that most countries have populations clustered in lower ranges, with a right-skewed distribution. Fewer countries have extremely large populations. 🏠📉
- **Conclusion**: Most countries have moderate to small populations, while only a few have very large populations, indicating a skewed global population distribution. 📊🌍

### Top 10 Most Populous Countries 🌏
- **Analysis**: The top 10 countries by population are:
  1. **China** - 1,421,775,000 🇨🇳
  2. **India** - 1,392,605,000 🇮🇳
  3. **United States** - 348,503,000 🇺🇸
  4. **Indonesia** - 274,925,000 🇮🇩
  5. **Pakistan** - 253,497,000 🇵🇰
  6. **Nigeria** - 230,928,000 🇳🇬
  7. **Brazil** - 215,812,000 🇧🇷
  8. **Bangladesh** - 168,171,000 🇧🇩
  9. **Russia** - 143,539,000 🇷🇺
  10. **Mexico** - 127,795,000 🇲🇽
- **Visualization**: The bar chart displays these countries and their populations. 📊
- **Conclusion**: China and India are the largest contributors to global population, with their combined population significantly surpassing that of other countries. 🌟🔝

### Least 10 Populous Countries 🌍
- **Analysis**: The least populous countries are:
  1. **Vatican City** - 803 🇻🇦
  2. **Nauru** - 10,956 🇳🇺
  3. **Tuvalu** - 13,032 🇹🇻
  4. **Palau** - 21,535 🇵🇼
  5. **San Marino** - 36,028 🇸🇲
  6. **Liechtenstein** - 38,869 🇱🇮
  7. **Monaco** - 39,694 🇲🇨
  8. **Saint Kitts and Nevis** - 57,192 🇰🇳
  9. **Marshall Islands** - 59,974 🇲🇭
  10. **Dominica** - 71,666 🇩🇲
- **Visualization**: The data is listed for clarity, and a table could be used to visualize this information. 📋
- **Conclusion**: Small countries like Vatican City and Nauru have minimal impact on global population totals but can have specific regional importance. 🌐

### Box Plot of Population Data 📊
- **Analysis**: The box plot shows the spread of population sizes with a broad range and several outliers. The central 50% of countries' populations are within a certain range, with some countries having populations far above or below this range. 📈
- **Conclusion**: There is significant variability in country populations, with diverse demographic profiles and several countries having exceptionally high or low populations. 📉🔍

### Choropleth Map 🌍🗺️
- **Analysis**: The map visualizes population densities, with high population concentrations in Asia and the Americas. Countries are colored based on their population sizes. 🌏
- **Conclusion**: Population densities are highest in Asia and the Americas, providing a clear view of global demographic distribution. 🌎📍

### Pie Chart of Top 10 Most Populous Countries 🥧
- **Analysis**: The pie chart shows the proportion of the global population held by the top 10 countries. For instance, China and India alone account for a significant portion of the global population. 🗺️
- **Conclusion**: The top 10 most populous countries collectively hold a major share of the global population. China and India together account for approximately 40% of the world's population. This high concentration underscores their global demographic influence. 🌟📊

## Summary of Key Findings 📌
- **Top Most Populous Country**: **China** with a population of 1,421,775,000 🇨🇳, accounting for approximately 18.3% of the global population. 🌍
- **Least Most Populous Country**: **Vatican City** with a population of 803 🇻🇦.
- **Percentage of Top 10 Countries**: The top 10 countries account for approximately 56% of the global population, with China and India together representing about 40%. 🌟📊
